# .cal file syntax
Start Block: The program starts with the start keyword.

start begins the block of code that will be processed.
End Block: The program ends with the end keyword.

end marks the end of the code block and will stop the program execution.
Calculations: You can write simple mathematical expressions like 5 + 3 or 10 * 2. These expressions will be evaluated.

Print: To output a result of a calculation, you use the print keyword followed by the expression you want to print.

print expression will print the result of the expression.
Comments: Comments are added using the # symbol at the beginning of a line. The interpreter ignores everything on that line after #.

Whitespace: The interpreter will ignore empty lines or extra spaces, so you can format your code as you like.
